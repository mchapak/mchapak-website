I am a post-doctoral researcher based at the Emory University, USA. My research interests include understanding complex human social interaction patterns, how these interactions may influence the mechanisms of transmission of respiratory infections, and how that information may be used to design infection transmission bottlenecks. From 2009-2020, while working at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme in Kilifi (Kenya), I led several studies focusing on the collection of social interaction data/ close mixing patterns in schools and households in rural and urban areas of coastal Kenya and Zimbabwe. In the Lopman research Group based at Emory University, I am part of a team that aims to understand social mixing patterns in four countries (Mozambique, India, Pakistan, and Guatemala) with a view to using the data in mathematical models to guide disease-prevention interventions such as infant or maternal vaccination programs.
